# My personal Resume

Hey there! I am [Lingyuan Ji](http://www.lingyuanji.com). This is the source code repo of my Resume. The `pdf` in the `master` branch of this repo is linked in my personal website.

## Installation
There is a compiled version of my resume in the repo. But if you wish to compile this doc locally, use
```
source make-resume.sh
```
Publication list will always be up to date as it is pulled automatically from [INSPIREHEP](http://www.inspirehep.net) by query `find a L.Ji.7` upon every document compilation.
